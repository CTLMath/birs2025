# Instructional Design for Computational Teaching and Learning

We will outline design principles for constructing computational learning materials with Python and Jupyter. We will articulate learning goals, identify problems and examples which align with learning goals, explore different levels of scaffolding and how to embed meaningful feedback for students.
