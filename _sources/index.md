# BIRS Workshop on Computational Teaching and Learning in Mathematics

*May 23-25, 2025*

Computational thinking is the process of formulating problems and their solutions in ways that a computer can implement, and computational teaching is the set of instructional practices designed for computational thinking. Computational teaching and learning have always been an important part of undergraduate mathematics education however student access to mathematical software and computational resources have been limited in the past.

Web-based, open-source mathematical software and computational resources are now more widely available than ever. [Python](https://python.org) is a general purpose programming language and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is a web-based development environment for creating computational documents. We propose to develop new modes of teaching and learning based on Python and Jupyter which promote computational thinking and which complement the current undergraduate mathematics curriculum.

## Objectives

* Outline a set of standards for computational teaching and learning in mathematics
* Provide explicit software training for instructors
* Create and share computational learning material and assessments
