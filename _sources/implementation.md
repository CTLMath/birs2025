# Strategies for Implementation

We will explore different systems of varying complexity to share, collect, grade and return computational documents. The simplest workflow involves Syzygy, a learning management system (LMS) and manual grading. We will also describe a workflow involving Syzygy, LMS, nbgrader and LMS API to manage, autograde and upload grades and feedback for thousands of students.
