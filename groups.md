# Working Groups

## Objectives

* Participants design computational learning material for their own courses
* Form groups based on similar interests and goals
* Organizers provide assistance

## Group 0

* Python module `ubcmath.py` containing common mathematical objects and functions for designing computational learning material for first year calculus and linear algebra courses assuming no student prior knowledge of Python and Jupyter
